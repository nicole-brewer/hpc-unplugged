# About

Women and minorities are highly underrepresented in computing education and occupations. To combat this trend in computing, there has been sustained outreach efforts and after-school programs at the middle school level - at a time in which students are known to be forming their identity and establishing interests. These programs often use "unplugged" lessons to teach computational thinking without the use of code or computers.

High-performance computing (HPC) involves the use of supercomputers to solve highly computation problems in science, engineering, math, and social science. A workforce with HPC expertise are highly sought after in academia, industry, and national labs, but women and minorities are even more underrepresented in this field than they are other computer and information technology occupations.

This lesson was developed to teach parallel and distributed computing principles to middle school students in an informal setting.
